## üìö 


I am a Ph.D. candidate  in **Trustworthy AI for Computer Vision Models & LLMs** and stochastic differential equations (**SDEs**).  I am interested in the following research themes:
- Optimization for vision models and LLMs
- Robustness and uncertainty
- Explainability and interpretability (XAI)
- Low-rank, quantization and neural architectural searching
- Theoretical research in optimization dynamics
- HPC and large-scale data processing 
- Digital sustainability, AI for good, AI for science, responsible AI, _etc_.

I've published in venues such as **TMLR**, **BMVC**, **SC**, **ICS**, and **HPCA**, with topics ranging from theoretical AI to high-performance computing. I also hold several **US patents** in the area of large-scale software data infrastructure.
